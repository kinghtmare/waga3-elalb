        <p>
          We are a team of 6 undergraduate students making a little robot under
          the guidance of the IEEE project PROTONS25! We are excited to share
          our adventure through the wonder, through hell of fire to the rising
          sea of electricity - every bit of testing and prototype, mechanical
          workshops and software crashes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We introduce to you first our specialized teams working in harmony to
          bring this robotic vision to life!

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            This project explores the design and implementation of a highly
            functional robotic system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller,
            designed to seamlessly integrate autonomous navigation and manual
            control capabilities. The robot operates in two distinct modes:
            <strong>Autonomous</strong>, where it follows a designated line on
            the ground using an array of five IR sensors, and
            <strong>Manual</strong>, which allows for direct control through a
            PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth.
          </p>

          <p>
            The implementation of a PID (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative)
            control system enables smooth and responsive navigation in
            <strong>Autonomous</strong> mode, allowing the robot to adjust its
            speed and direction based on real-time feedback from the sensors.
          </p>

          <p>
            To enhance versatility, the robot features four DC motors
            strategically selected to balance torque and speed, providing
            optimal performance under varying loads. one servo for the hammr
            mechanism.

                    We initially selected this base; however, upon further

                  <p>
                    The base wasn't well-balanced, so we were concerned the

                    Additionally, there is a removable line at the back that can

                  <p>

                    enable the gripper hand to hold the ball. The design also
                    incorporates two gears that transfer the movement of the
                    servo
                    motor to the gripper's hands.

                  <p>
                    We added an additional task by creating an arm that holds
                    the
                    gripper. The advantage of incorporating this arm is that, if
                    the ball is dropped, the arm can lower itself to retrieve
                    it.
